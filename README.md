# superbattleship

This is a web Battleship game which you can play against an AI opponent.
I did not create the game events or AI, but simply developed the front end design and connected the controls to the back end
using modern web development techniques.

I created the map using tables in HTML and colors in CSS, manipulating classes and ID's of different objects.
I created all of the controls of the game using event handlers in JavaScript.
The ships move and rotate using arrow keys or buttons, you can shoot by clicking or by typing in coordinates, and you can
get information about the ships left in your fleet.  The game events are all printed on the page in a log.

To play the game run the SuperBattleship.html file.
